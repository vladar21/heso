## ERP diagram

This database schema outlines the structure of a system designed to manage classes, lessons, and materials for an educational institution. It includes **User** to record both teachers and students, **EnglishClass** for details of each class including its teacher and students, **Lesson** for specific class sessions with attributes such as timing and status, and **Material** for educational content. Junction tables **EnglishClass_Students** and **Lesson_Materials** support many-to-many relationships, allowing for the flexible association of students with classes and materials with lessons.

## Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Install Project Dependencies

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file by executing the following command in the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 2: Configure the Database

Configure the connection to the PostgreSQL database in the `settings.py` file of your Django project.

### Step 3: Apply Migrations

* Apply migrations to create the database tables by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Step 4: Run the Server

* Start the Django development server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Step 5: Populate Data

1. To populate the database with dummy data, execute the `populate_data.py` script using the `python manage.py shell` command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py shell
    ```
2. Run the `populate_data.py` script in the Django interactive shell:

    ```python
    exec(open('populate_data.py').read())
    ```
3. **Note:** Upon initialization, **SuperAdmin** is created with the password:

    ```bash
     heso_password
    ```

    Other users, like **teacher1**, **teacher2**, **student1**...**student10** are created, all with the password:

    ```bash
     password123
    ```

### Step 6: Clean Database (Optional)

1. You can clean the database at any time using the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py flush
    ```

2. After cleaning the database, follow steps 1-2 to set up the database again.

### Step 7: Start with an Empty Database (Optional)

1. If you prefer not to use the `populate_data.py` script and start with an empty database, you can create a Superuser by running the command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to create a superuser, including providing a username, email address, and password.

## Bugs

### 1. Doubling while saving new material

- **Description:** When we add new material in the upload form, in the list of lesson materials we see double titles of ones.

  <img src="assets/images/doubling_while_saving_new_material.jpg" width="600" alt="doubling while saving new material">

- **Solution:** Using the get_or_create method on the backend, which allows you to get an existing material or create a new one if it doesn't exist.

  ```bash
  # Update materials if provided
  if 'materials' in data:
      material_ids = data['materials']
      lesson.materials.clear()
      lesson.materials.set(Material.objects.filter(id__in=material_ids))
  
  if request.FILES.getlist('new_materials'):
      for uploaded_file in request.FILES.getlist('new_materials'):
          if uploaded_file:
              material, created = Material.objects.get_or_create(
                  title=uploaded_file.name,
                  type="file",
                  content=uploaded_file.read()
              )
              if created:
                  lesson.materials.add(material)
  
  lesson.save()
  ```
  ### 2. Don't highlight current menu item

- **Description:** When the user clicks on a menu item that doesn't have an active class (highlighted in bold white).

  <img src="assets/images/not_highlighting_current_menu_item.jpg" width="600" alt="not highlighting current menu item">

- **Solution:** Need accurate writing of the URL to use for comparisons.

 <img src="assets/images/fix_not_highlighting_current_menu_item.jpg" width="600" alt="fix not highlighting current menu item">

  ### 3. Incorrect message for unauthorised user actions

- **Description:** Incorrect message when non-authorised user clicks on website items.

  <img src="assets/images/wron_message_for_unautorized_access.jpg" width="600" alt="wrong message for unautorized access">

- **Solution:** Change JavaScript handler for these situations.

 <img src="assets/images/fix_code_wron_message_for_unautorized_access.jpg" width="600" alt="fix code for fix wrong message for unautorized access">

 - **Result:** Correct message (from server).

## Overview

HESO is tailored to facilitate the organization and management of class schedules, enhancing the efficiency of educational processes in online English language schools.


## Usage

1. **Class Schedule Accessibility**:
   - The class schedule is accessible to all users, whether they are registered or not.

2. **User Roles**:
   - **SuperAdmin**: Manages the website and user administration.
   - **Teacher**: Responsible for managing classes and lessons, as well as interacting with students.
   - **Student**: Can view class schedules.

3. **Access Rights**:
   - **SuperAdmin** has full access to all classes, lessons, and materials and can make changes to any of them.
   - **Teacher** has the right to manage the classes and lessons they are assigned to, as well as create new classes.
   - **Student** can view the general schedule of lessons and only has access to lessons available for their class.

4. **Registration and Role Assignment**:
   - SuperAdmin is created programmatically during project initialization.
   - When registering a new user, they are automatically assigned the role of Student.
   - The SuperAdmin can change a user's role from Student to Teacher in the administrative panel.

5. **Automatic Teacher Assignment**:
   - When a teacher creates a new class, they are automatically assigned as the teacher of that class.

6. **Teacher Rights**:
   - Teachers have full access to manage the classes and lessons they are assigned to, as well as the ability to create new classes.

7. **Student Rights**:
   - Students can only view the schedule of lessons and information about their assigned classes.

8. The procedure of the **Assigning roles** in the system:
    - SuperAdmin is assigned programmatically, using:
      ```bash
      python manage.py creatsuperuser
      ```
    - Any new user who registers on the site gets the role of Student by default.
    - SuperAdmin, through the admin panel (/admin), can make any Student a Teacher, or vice versa.

9. **Summary**:
    - SuperAdmin can CRUD all Classes, Lessons, Materials, and has access to admin panel for users managment.
    - Teachers can CRUD for Classes and Lessons for Classes they teach.
    - Students can only view Classes and Lessons for Classes they are enrolled in.
    - If the user does not have any of these roles, they are not allowed to view the Classes list and Lesson's details.

### Unit Tests Suite Overview

- Our test suite ensures the robustness and functionality of user management and scheduling within the application. Tests are categorized by focus areas for clarity.

#### User Management Tests
- `User Registration Validation`: Tests validate the user registration form with correct and incorrect inputs, ensuring only valid data passes.
- `Duplicate Registration Handling`: Confirms the system prevents users from registering with a username or email that already exists.
- `Password Strength Enforcement`: Verifies that user registration rejects common and easily guessable passwords to enhance security.
- `User Logout Process`: Tests the logout functionality, ensuring users are properly logged out and redirected.
- `Authenticated Redirection`: Verifies that authenticated users are redirected from the login and registration pages to prevent redundant registrations or logins.

#### Scheduling System Tests
- `Access Control`: Ensures that only authorized roles (e.g., teachers, students) can access specific scheduling functionalities like viewing schedules, creating classes, or updating lessons.
- `Class and Lesson Management`: Tests the creation, updating, and deletion of classes and lessons by authorized users, ensuring the application correctly handles these operations.
- `Lesson Details Accessibility`: Confirms that lesson details are accessible to users with the appropriate permissions, including teachers and enrolled students.
- `Scheduling Views`: Validates that the scheduling views render correctly for different user roles, providing the necessary information as expected.

## Bugs

### 1. Doubling while saving new material

- **Description:** When we add new material in the upload form, in the list of lesson materials we see double titles of ones.

  <img src="assets/images/doubling_while_saving_new_material.jpg" width="600" alt="doubling while saving new material">

- **Solution:** Using the get_or_create method on the backend, which allows you to get an existing material or create a new one if it doesn't exist.

  ```bash
  # Update materials if provided
  if 'materials' in data:
      material_ids = data['materials']
      lesson.materials.clear()
      lesson.materials.set(Material.objects.filter(id__in=material_ids))
  
  if request.FILES.getlist('new_materials'):
      for uploaded_file in request.FILES.getlist('new_materials'):
          if uploaded_file:
              material, created = Material.objects.get_or_create(
                  title=uploaded_file.name,
                  type="file",
                  content=uploaded_file.read()
              )
              if created:
                  lesson.materials.add(material)
  
  lesson.save()
  ```
  ### 2. Don't highlight current menu item

- **Description:** When the user clicks on a menu item that doesn't have an active class (highlighted in bold white).

  <img src="assets/images/not_highlighting_current_menu_item.jpg" width="600" alt="not highlighting current menu item">

- **Solution:** Need accurate writing of the URL to use for comparisons.

 <img src="assets/images/fix_not_highlighting_current_menu_item.jpg" width="600" alt="fix not highlighting current menu item">

  ### 3. Incorrect message for unauthorised user actions

- **Description:** Incorrect message when non-authorised user clicks on website items.

  <img src="assets/images/wron_message_for_unautorized_access.jpg" width="600" alt="wrong message for unautorized access">

- **Solution:** Change JavaScript handler for these situations.

 <img src="assets/images/fix_code_wron_message_for_unautorized_access.jpg" width="600" alt="fix code for fix wrong message for unautorized access">

 - **Result:** Correct message (from server).
